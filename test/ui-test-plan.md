# Minty A-Personality UI Test Plan

Reminder date boundaries, ordering, persistence, lifecycle changes, and console startup are tested
with a fixed clock in JUnit. TC23 checks exact console syntax and empty output.

### GUI6: Startup reminders

Using an isolated data file, save an incomplete deadline due today, then restart Minty.
Expected: one separate reminder bubble follows the greeting, showing the deadline's original list number.
Enter `remind` and `reminders`; both show the same text. Mark the task done, then restart:
no reminder bubble appears. Existing conversation bubbles remain unchanged after marking.

These tests run with Java 25. Each test starts a fresh instance of Minty's command-line backend and compares the
complete console output exactly. The JavaFX launcher and chat controls are verified separately with a startup smoke
test and computer-use test because rendered windows cannot be compared as console text.

## Coverage summary

| Behavior | Happy path | Error and boundary coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `todo` | TC1, TC8–TC10 | TC4 |
| `deadline` | TC1, TC5, TC6, TC9, TC10 | TC6 |
| `event` | TC1, TC5, TC7, TC9, TC10 | TC7 |
| `list` | TC1, TC2, TC3, TC5–TC8, TC10 | TC3 checks an empty list |
| `mark` and `unmark` | TC1, TC2, TC8, TC9 | TC8 |
| `delete` | TC2, TC9 | TC3 |
| Unknown or empty command | — | TC4 |
| Save after task-list changes | TC9 | — |
| Missing data file and folder | TC9 | — |
| Load task types and statuses | TC10 | — |
| Blank lines and escaped delimiters | TC11 | — |
| Invalid saved task status | — | TC12 |
| Unknown saved task type | — | TC13 |
| Missing saved task fields | — | TC14 |
| Empty saved task details | — | TC15 |
| Invalid saved escape sequence | — | TC16 |
| Unsupported saved escape sequence | — | TC17 |
| Parse and format ISO dates | TC1, TC5, TC10 | TC18 |
| Invalid dates in saved data | — | TC19, TC20 |
| `on` date query | TC21 | TC21 |
| `find` keyword search | TC22 | TC22 |
| Startup and `bye` | TC1–TC22 | — |

The use of `ArrayList<Task>` is an implementation detail and is verified by code review rather than console output. The UI tests verify its observable add, lookup, renumbering, and deletion behavior.

## JavaFX GUI checks

These checks are performed through the running desktop window rather than by the console test script.

### GUI1: Send a command with the button

1. Enter `todo read book` in the command field.
2. Click **Send**.

Expected: The conversation shows the command and Minty's confirmation, and the command field is cleared.

### GUI2: Send a command with Enter

1. Enter `list` in the command field.
2. Press Enter.

Expected: Minty shows the stored task and the conversation scrolls to the newest response.

### GUI3: Recover from invalid input

1. Enter `todo` in the command field.
2. Click **Send**.

Expected: Minty says "Let's give that task a name! Try todo read a book.", and the window remains usable.

### GUI4: Exit the conversation

1. Enter `bye` in the command field.
2. Press Enter.

Expected: Minty shows its goodbye message and disables the command field and Send button.

### GUI5: Display themed images

1. Start Minty and send any valid command.
2. Inspect the welcome message and both sides of the new exchange.

Expected: The botanical mint background fills the window. Minty's leaf mascot appears to the left of its messages,
and the user avatar appears to the right of user messages without obscuring the message text.

### GUI7: Identity bar and themed bubbles

1. Start Minty and inspect the header and greeting.
2. Send `list`, then an invalid command, and scroll through the conversation.
3. Resize the window down to its minimum size and then enlarge it.

Expected: A fixed cream header shows the mascot, green Minty title, and
"Your fresh little task buddy" subtitle. The conversation scrolls below it.
Minty's cream bubbles have green outlines and small tails pointing toward the
mascot; user bubbles are pale mint. Text wraps without clipping, and the header
and input remain separate from the conversation at every supported size.

### GUI8: Expressive mascot avatars

1. Add `todo read book`, then enter `mark 1`.
2. Enter `mark 99`, then `list`, then `bye`.
3. Inspect the avatars alongside each response.

Expected: The add and list responses use the original mascot. Successful marking
uses the celebrating mascot. The invalid task number uses the curious mascot.
Goodbye uses the waving mascot and disables input. Earlier bubbles keep their
original expressions. All avatars have transparent backgrounds and fit the
existing avatar space; the identity bar keeps the original mascot.

### GUI9: Friendly input and spacing

1. Focus the empty input field and inspect its hint and green outline.
2. Add a task with Enter and another with Send, then enter `list`.
3. Resize to the minimum window size, navigate with Tab, and enter `bye`.

Expected: The hint reads "What’s next? Try todo read a book". Focus has a
clear green outline; Send has hover, pressed, and keyboard-focus feedback.
Messages have comfortable padding and line spacing; task numbers are followed
by a space. The input and button fit without overlapping the conversation.
Both submission methods clear the field, and goodbye disables both controls.

### GUI10: Bundled Nunito typography

1. Start Minty without installing Nunito as a system font.
2. Inspect the header, subtitle, messages, input, and Send button.
3. Add a long task and list tasks at the minimum window width.

Expected: Nunito is used throughout: ExtraBold 23px for the title, Regular
15px for messages, Regular 14px for input, Bold 14px for Send, and Regular
12px for the subtitle. Text wraps without clipping and the input hint fits.

### GUI11: Message dividers

1. Send `list`, add a task, and send `list` again.
2. Inspect both user and Minty messages at the minimum window width.

Expected: A thin muted-green horizontal divider appears below each message,
inset from the window edges, with space between the line and the bubble or
avatar. Lines span the conversation width regardless of bubble length.

### GUI12: Response colors and error emphasis

1. Add a task, mark it, and enter `list`.
2. Enter an invalid command and an invalid task number.
3. Enter `reminders`, then another valid command.

Expected: Successful task changes use pale green bubbles; list/search and
ordinary conversation use cream; reminders use pale blue. Errors use soft red
with dark-red text and a "Needs attention" heading. Speech tails match each
bubble. Subsequent responses use their own colors, and old bubbles stay unchanged.
Startup reminders also use pale blue. Save failures take priority over success.

### GUI13: Softened conversation background

1. Start Minty and compare the center of the conversation with its edges.
2. Send enough messages to scroll and resize the window.

Expected: A cream wash softens leaves through the middle of the conversation,
fading smoothly to richer foliage at both edges. The wash stays fixed behind
the scrolling messages and adapts to the viewport width. Avatars, bubbles,
header, input controls, and text retain their normal colors and opacity.

### GUI15: Existing duplicate tasks

Start Minty with a saved file containing duplicate task details, including
completed copies. Enter `list` and add a different task.

Expected: Every saved task loads in its original order and status, saving
continues normally, and no corruption warning appears. Adding another copy
of an existing task still reports the duplicate-input error.

### GUI14: Recover from input and storage errors

1. Enter a command with extra spaces or tabs and verify it is accepted.
2. Add the same task twice and repeat /by in a deadline command.
3. With an isolated malformed data file, restart the GUI and add a task.

Expected: Input errors use red bubbles and explain recovery. A startup warning
appears in a red bubble when loading fails. New tasks stay in the session, but
saving is blocked so the original malformed file is preserved. Repair or move
the file and restart to resume saving. Missing files start an empty list normally.

## TC1: Add, mark, and list all task types

Aim: Verify that todos, deadlines, and events are created with the correct details, retain their types when marked, and appear correctly in the task list.

### Input

```text
todo borrow book
deadline do homework /by 2019-12-02
event project meeting /from 2019-12-03 /to 2019-12-04

## TC8: Handle numeric boundaries and surrounding whitespace

Aim: Verify that descriptions are trimmed, valid signed or zero-padded task numbers work, and missing, non-numeric, non-positive, overflowing, or out-of-range task numbers leave state unchanged.

## TC9: Save after every task-list change

Aim: Verify that Minty starts without an existing data file or folder, creates both automatically, and writes after each successful add, mark, delete, and unmark operation.
